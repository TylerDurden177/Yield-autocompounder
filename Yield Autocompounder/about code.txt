This is a Solidity smart contract code for an auto compounding platform. 
The contract allows users to deposit tokens into the platform and the deposited tokens earn interest over time. 
The contract provides functions for deposit, withdraw, compounding interest, updating interest rate, adding new tokens and removing tokens. 
The contract has a mapping to store the balances of users and another mapping to store the interest rates of different tokens. 
The contract also maintains a pool of interest earned from all deposited tokens. The contract is owned by a single owner who has the privilege to add, remove and update the interest rates of tokens. 
The contract logs several events for deposit, withdrawal, compounding interest, updating interest rate, adding and removing tokens.
